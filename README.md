WIP project to create a so-called "companion" add-on board for [Altus Metrum](https://altusmetrum.org/) flight computers. This companion board is intended to transmit realtime pressure data to the flight computer using a high-pressure pressure sensor for motor characterization similar to the [EasyMotor](https://altusmetrum.org/EasyMotor/), using a low-cost RP2040 based microcontroller board.
